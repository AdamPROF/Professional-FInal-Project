# Professional-Final-Project
This is a coding introduction game.
This game consists of four rooms designed to help users learn about programming languages.

The first three rooms are dedicated to teaching you about some basic programming languages. Each room will present you with information about the language and give you some basic knowledge that you can use to solve the puzzles in the fourth room.

The fourth room is a quiz where you will be asked questions about the programming languages you learned about in the first three rooms. To answer the questions, you will need to drag and drop the correct answers to the corresponding questions.

This game is perfect for beginners who want to learn about programming languages in a fun and interactive way. It is also great for experienced programmers who want to brush up on their knowledge of these languages.

To play the game, simply run the Pygame program on your device. Use the arrow keys to move your character around the rooms and interact with the objects in the game. You can also use the mouse to drag and drop answers in the fourth room quiz.
